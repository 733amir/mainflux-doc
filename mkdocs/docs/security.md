# Security
For professional deployments Mainflux is combined with [Mainflux Authentication and Authorization Server](https://github.com/mainflux/mainflux-auth-server) which adds fine-grained security based on customizable API keys.

Mainflux Auth Server also provides user accounts and device and application access control with simple customizable scheme based on scoped JWTs.
